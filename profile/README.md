**Objective:**

To develop or submit an existing fully functional digital wallet application that is compatible with both web and mobile platforms, utilizing Passwordless BSA as the sole authentication method. Additionally, the same mobile application will serve as the application’s authenticator for Passwordless BSA.

**Key Digital Wallet Application Requirements:**

**Basic Functionalities:**
- UI/UX (including but not limited to home page, splash screen, intuitiveness of the application flow, branding, functioning menus/buttons, overall visuals and aesthetics)
- User account registration and account deletion
- User account login and logout
- Push notifications

**Digital Wallet Features:**
- Implement balance inquiry functionality allowing users to check their wallet balance.
- Include a transaction history feature enabling users to view their past transactions.
- Enable wallet-to-wallet transfers allowing users to send funds to other users' wallets.
- Implement wallet reloading functionality enabling users to add funds to their wallets.

**Passwordless Blockchain Secure Authentication (BSA) Authentication:**
- Device Registration/Deregistration for BSA
- Mobile application component to function as authenticator for BSA authentication.
- Implement Passwordless BSA for 3 key components:
  - **Login:** Users must authenticate using BSA to access the digital wallet application.
  - **Access Control:** Users must further authenticate to access restricted sections such as the user profile and Account Balances page.
  - **Payment Transactions:** BSA authentication is required before executing any wallet-to-wallet transfers or wallet reloading actions.

**Here is the outline of Digital Wallet Application (DWA)’s minimum expected functionalities, including but not limited to the list below:**

**Participants have the freedom to exercise creativity and incorporate additional features into the Digital Wallet Application, as long as they meet the minimum expected functionalities.**

The following items will be provided to each participant:
- BSA Web SDK and documentation
- BSA Mobile SDK and documentation
- BSA Documentation (APK Manuals, User Onboarding Manuals, Server Provision guidelines)
- FNSPay Demo application and documentation (for reference)

**Note for participants:**
- For mobile application development, participants shall develop on Android platforms only.
- The BSA-integrated mobile application will serve as the application’s authenticator for Passwordless BSA.
- For the web and mobile application, participants can choose to either develop or utilize their own existing DWA.
- Participants without infrastructure for the development of the Digital Wallet Application may request for server provisioning after creating/joining a team.
